#TODO Add a third test student and assign them four classes

#TODO Add all the test students to a list of your own creation

#TODO print student_list

#TODO iterate over each of the students in the list and print their names and course schedules.
    #Each iteration should:
        #print the student
'''for this part you may need to review the other skeleton code to:
        - see how to get items from a list
        - see if there is code (like a function) in that file you can call in this file
        - verify that running this file gets you the correct output with information from that file
    Also, review syntax of pulling items from a list from other activities'''
